# MyGUI-SFML

A C++ library to easily use MyGUI in an SFML application.

## Building

Unfortunately, MyGUI does not export cmake configuration files. Hence, you will have to modify the MyGUI part of [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/pvigier/MyGUI-SFML/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt) to be able to build.

Alternatively, you can install MyGUI in an `ext` folder. Then, no change should be necessary.

## Usage

See the [example](https://github.com/pvigier/MyGUI-SFML/blob/master/examples/main.cpp) for a complete example.
